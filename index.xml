Thanks for wanting to help out with tech. This document will outline our general workflow, and help you get set up to contribute to our projects.
Sadly, this document also must go over environment setup, which is the worst part of any coding project! Generally, we try to make things as easy as possible through tools like GNU Make and Docker.
Windows-Specific Instructions These tools work out of the box on MacOS/Linux, but require a good amount of configuration on Windows.</description></item><item><title>Homework and Hacking</title><link>https://hackwashu.com/events/hw_and_hacking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackwashu.com/events/hw_and_hacking/</guid><description>Homework and Hacking Homework and Hacking runs every Wednesday night from 7-10 pm in &amp;lt;&amp;gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
